<p>Hello! My name is Annabel Berin. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, but I'm currently studying in New York at the New School. My path of study combines the likes of psychology, culture, marketing, and gender studies. I've created my own major in Creative Marketing with a concentration in consumer psychology. This website provides my resume and contact information, as well as the designs and calligraphy I do.</p></div>
